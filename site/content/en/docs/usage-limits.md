`ccam usage` shows, for every account, how much of each limit is used: the 5-hour limit, the weekly limit and each model's own weekly limit (such as Fable). `ccam next --auto` opens the account with the most room, and `--continue` carries the current conversation over.

```console
$ ccam usage

   5-hour   ██████████████░░░░░░  72%  resets in 1h 40m

   5-hour   ████████████████████ 100%  resets in 22m

   Fable    ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░  40%  resets in 1d 9h
→ Most headroom: work   (open it with ccam next --auto)
```

Each account gets a line with how old its numbers are, then one bar per limit with the time until it resets: the 5-hour window, the weekly window for all models, and each model's own weekly window, such as Fable. A bar turns yellow at 80% and red at 100%. The last line names the account `ccam next --auto` would open; with `auto_strategy = "expiring"` or `"balance"` it reads `→ next --auto picks <name>: <reason>` instead.

**Team and Enterprise seats.** Automatic account selection (`ccam next`, `--fallback`, `ccam pick`, the dashboard's `n` and, once you turn it on, [`auto_switch`](/features/next#auto-switch)) also switches between seats of the same Claude Team or Enterprise organization, which may violate Anthropic's terms. Read the [FAQ](/docs/faq#am-i-allowed-to-use-several-claude-code-accounts) and check with your organization and Anthropic before you rely on it.

## Where the numbers come from

ccam asks Anthropic's usage endpoint for every account at the same time, using each account's own login. It waits at most 3 seconds per account and shows each account as soon as it answers.

This endpoint is not publicly documented and may change. When a request fails, ccam shows the last known numbers and marks them as cached. A window that has reset since those numbers were saved shows 0%. `ccam doctor` tells you if the response format has changed.

When Claude Code stops a session at a usage limit, the [ccam plugin](/docs/install#claude-code-plugin) records which window was full and when it resets. Until then that window shows 100% whatever the other numbers say, so `ccam next --auto` and `--fallback` do not pick the account again too early.

Numbers fetched less than 60 seconds ago are reused. Options:

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--watch[=seconds]` | Refresh continuously, every 60 seconds by default |
| `--json` | Machine-readable output |
| `-v` | Also show where each account's numbers came from |
| `--no-cache` | Always ask again |
| `--source cache` | Never ask; show saved numbers only |

## Expired logins

When an account's access token has expired, ccam does not renew it, because renewing it while a Claude Code session uses the same login could sign that session out. The account shows ``access token expired; `ccam <name>` renews it when it starts``: start it once with `ccam <name>` and Claude Code renews it. A login that has fully expired, or that Claude Code cleared, shows `` login expired → `ccam login <name>` `` and needs a new login.

`ccam usage --refresh` renews expired tokens itself, but only for accounts with no running Claude Code session, however that session was started. It never renews logins stored in the macOS Keychain or in an imported `~/.claude`, and a renewal may take up to 30 seconds.

## Usage in the status line

```sh
ccam statusline install
```

Claude Code then shows the account name and its usage in the status line, for example `[work] · Opus · 5h 24% · 7d 41%`. From 90% on, the line also suggests `ccam next --auto --continue`. If you already have a status line command, ccam keeps it and puts the account name in front. The status line also saves its numbers, which `ccam usage` uses when the endpoint does not answer.

## Switching

```sh
ccam next             # the account after the one you used last
ccam next --auto      # the account with the lowest 5-hour usage
ccam next --continue  # continue this folder's conversation on the next account
```

`ccam next` skips accounts that are not logged in, and `--auto` skips accounts at 100% (including a window Claude Code reported full, until its reset) and accounts of another organization. When the two accounts share conversation history, `--continue` opens the same conversation; otherwise Claude Code copies it into the new account. See [sharing](/docs/sharing) and [switching to the next account](/features/next#continue).

With `auto_switch = true` at the top of `config.toml` (Linux and macOS; off by default), ccam makes this switch itself when Claude Code stops an interactive session at its limit and another account of the same kind (a seat in the same organization, or another personal plan) has room. See [`auto_switch`](/features/next#auto-switch) for when it acts and what it never does.

For scripts and scheduled jobs that run `claude -p`, put `--fallback` before the account name. When that account reaches its limit, ccam runs the same command again as the account with the most room, and only the output of the run that finished is printed:

```sh
ccam --fallback work -p "review the diff" --output-format json
```

See [Run again at the limit](/features/next#run-again-at-the-limit) for how ccam decides.

The [usage limit workflow guide](/guides/usage-limit-workflow) walks through a full example.

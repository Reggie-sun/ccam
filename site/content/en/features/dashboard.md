`ccam` without arguments opens a full-screen dashboard when standard input and output are a terminal; otherwise it prints `ccam list`. The dashboard shows every account with its usage and groups, and does what the commands do: launch, add, log in, change groups, set folder rules, list background sessions, check and repair. Launching, or attaching to a background session, closes it; adding an account or logging in hands the terminal over for a moment, then returns to the dashboard.

```console
 ccam v0.10.0 · 3 accounts · 2 groups     ✔ default · ▸ this folder · • running

  Accounts   Agents   Groups   Folders   Extensions   Health    auto_switch off
 Your Claude accounts and their usage limits; enter launches the selected one.

    # Account      5-hour       Weekly       Fable        Last  Groups
   1. personal ✔   ████▍░  72%  ██▌░░░  41%  █████▎  88%  -     default
 ❯ 2. work      ▸• █▌░░░░  25%  ██████ 100%  ▋░░░░░  10%  -     default team
   3. side         ✘ not logged in                        -     no group

 enter to launch · n for most room · a to add · s for groups · ? for shortcuts
```

The line under the tab names says in one sentence what the current tab is for. On a wider terminal the Accounts tab also shows each account's email. On every tab, the end of the tab line shows whether [`auto_switch`](/features/next#auto-switch) is on (Linux and macOS; Windows ignores it). When it is on, the Health tab lists what it still needs: Claude Code 2.1.214 or later, and the ccam plugin turned on in every account that signs in with a Claude subscription.

Each time it opens, the dashboard asks GitHub in the background whether a newer ccam release exists; the first frame never waits for it, and when you are offline, nothing is shown. When there is one, a line under the title recommends it:

```console
 ● ccam 0.10.2 is available (you have 0.10.1) · press U to update
```

`U` asks first, then updates the way [`ccam update`](/features/update) does: the release is checked against its SHA-256 checksums and replaces ccam in one step. The dashboard you are in is still the old version, so quit and start `ccam` again. When the update cannot be done here, for example for a copy of ccam installed from the `.deb` package, the dashboard shows the same advice as `ccam update` and keeps the offer.

The first frame draws from `config.toml` alone, in well under 100 ms; usage fills in as each account answers. Each limit has its own bar: the 5-hour window, the weekly window for all models, and Fable's own weekly window; `-` means the account has no such window. A percentage turns yellow at 80% and red at 100%. If a lookup fails, cached values are shown dimmed. A window Claude Code reported full shows 100% until its reset. An expired access token shows a faint `⚠ token expired` (Claude Code renews it at the next start), while `⚠ login expired` means the account needs `ccam login`.

## Tabs

| Tab | What it shows | Keys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accounts | number, name, email, 5-hour, weekly and Fable bars, last use, groups; `✔` the default, `▸` this folder's account, `•` running (also Claude Code started without ccam: plain `claude`, an IDE, background sessions and their daemon) | below |
| Agents | what [`ccam agents`](/features/agents) lists: the background sessions and open sessions of every account, with their state, folder and start time (below) | `enter` attach (as `ccam attach`), `x` stop, `r` reload |
| Groups | each group, what it shares and its accounts, and the accounts in no group | `enter` edit, `n` new, `e` rename, `x` remove |
| Folders | the [`ccam folder`](/features/folder) rules and the one that applies here, even when you reached the folder through a symbolic link (new rules are stored with links resolved) | `n` use an account here, `enter` change, `x` remove |
| Extensions | what [`ccam ext`](/features/ext) shows, each extension once with the groups it comes from, `off:` the accounts where a plugin is not turned on, the account's own servers that apply to this folder only, `This folder's project`, and problems that belong to no account | `r` reload |
| Health | what [`ccam doctor`](/features/doctor) reports, as a box per account (below) | `f` repair the selected box, `F` repair all (`doctor --fix`), `↑`/`↓` move between boxes |

`←`/`→` or `Tab` switch tabs, `?` lists the keys of the current tab, `r` refreshes usage, bypassing the short cache, and loads the Agents, Extensions and Health tabs again, and `q` or `Esc` quits.

## Keys on the Accounts tab

| Key | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Start Claude Code as the selected account |
| `1`–`9` | Move to the account with that number; type `1` `2` quickly for 12. Only `Enter` launches |
| `↑`/`↓`, `k`/`j` | Move |
| `n` | Start the account [`ccam next --auto`](/features/next) would choose |
| `o` | Start with options: `--continue`, `--resume`, other arguments, or a dry run |
| `u` | Usage details: 5-hour, weekly and model windows with their resets and where the numbers come from |
| `a` | Add an account (the wizard below) |
| `l` | Log in again |
| `s` | Choose the account's groups |
| `d` | Make it the default account |
| `f` | Use it in the current folder |
| `e` | Rename it |
| `c` | Set or remove its shortcut command |
| `x` | Remove it (asks first, with No selected) |

**Team and Enterprise seats.** Automatic account selection (`ccam next`, `--fallback`, `ccam pick`, the dashboard's `n` and, once you turn it on, [`auto_switch`](/features/next#auto-switch)) also switches between seats of the same Claude Team or Enterprise organization, which may violate Anthropic's terms. Read the [FAQ](/docs/faq#am-i-allowed-to-use-several-claude-code-accounts) and check with your organization and Anthropic before you rely on it.

## The Health tab

The Health tab runs the checks of [`ccam doctor`](/features/doctor) when you open it and draws the same view: a first line with a mark per account, then a box per account. Each row in a box is one area that was checked, `Folder`, `Login` and `Share links` first, marked `✔` OK, `ℹ` information, `⚠` a warning or `✘` an error, so you see at once which account has a problem and where. Findings that belong to no account go in a `General` box.

```console
 ✘ personal   ⚠ work

 ╭─ ✘ personal · 3 problems ─────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
 │ ⚠ Folder       folder permissions are 755 (should be 0700)                │

 4 problems; f repairs the selected box, F all of them (ccam doctor --fix).
```

`↑`/`↓` move from box to box, and the selected box has an accent-colored border. `f` repairs only the selected box, the way `ccam doctor --fix` would: on an account's box it repairs that account alone, and on the `General` box the findings of no account (plugin paths and shortcuts); every other account is only checked again. It asks first (``Like `ccam doctor --fix`: missing links and group folders are made, and a real file where a link belongs is backed up first; where the group has its own copy, the account then sees the group's. Nothing is lost.``), and a box with nothing to repair just says `nothing to repair in <name>`. `F` repairs everything at once, like `ccam doctor --fix`, and `r` checks again.

## The Agents tab

The Agents tab shows what [`ccam agents`](/features/agents) prints: the background sessions and open sessions of every account, with the account each belongs to. It asks every account's Claude Code at once (`claude agents --json`, each with a 15-second timeout) when you first open the tab, on `r`, after a stop, and after a change to the config, and says `Asking every account's Claude Code for its sessions…` until all have answered.

```console
  Accounts   Agents   Groups   Folders   Extensions   Health    auto_switch off
 Background agents and open sessions of every account; enter attaches to one.

    Account   ID        Name   State          Folder      Started
 ❯  work      -         -      open (busy)    ~/code/web  now
    personal  49ec0028  probe  blocked, idle  ~/code/app  12m

 ✘ lab: could not list its sessions: exit status 1 'claude agents --json' is
   not available in this environment.

 enter to attach · x to stop · r to reload · ? for shortcuts
```

`State` is a background session's state and what its process is doing, or `open` for an interactive session, as in `ccam agents`. If an account cannot be queried, a `✘` line under the list shows what Claude Code said, like `lab` above, which has its agent view turned off. Finished background sessions are left out (`ccam agents --all` lists them), and when every account answered and none has a session, the tab says ``No sessions. Start one in the background with `ccam <account> --bg "…"`.`` On a narrow terminal the tab drops `Started`, then `Name`, then `Folder`, and truncates long folder paths from the left.

`Enter` on a background session closes the dashboard and opens the session in this terminal as its account, the way `ccam attach <id>` does; the dashboard does not come back (in Claude Code, `←` goes to its agent view and `Ctrl+Z` to the shell). An open session has no ID, so `Enter` and `x` only say that a background session is needed. `x` asks first, with `No, keep it` selected: ``It runs as personal. Like `ccam personal stop 49ec0028`, Claude Code stops it and keeps its conversation, which `ccam attach 49ec0028` opens again.`` On yes, ccam runs `claude stop <id>` as that account, says ``49ec0028 (personal) stopped; `ccam attach 49ec0028` opens it again`` or why it could not, and reads the list again.

## Changing groups

On the Groups tab, `Enter` opens the editor: the items on the left, the accounts on the right, `Tab` to switch, `Space` to toggle. An item that one of the accounts already gets from another group is grayed out with the reason, as is an account that would get an item twice; an item can come from one group only. `Enter` shows the plan:

```console
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Groups of side

  ● side  +history (group team)
    ⎿  link     projects, history.jsonl: profiles/side → groups/team

  Do you want to apply this plan?
  ❯ 1. Yes
    2. No
```

If a file differs from the group's copy, ccam first asks what to do (keep the group's, use mine or merge). Then the change runs in the background with the same code as [`ccam group`](/features/share): the config is saved first, each account's data moves in order, and the originals go to `.ccam-backup/`; an account that leaves MCP sharing keeps the group's servers in its `.claude.json`.

A change that would move the data of a running account is refused with the account's name, even when the account started while the plan was open, and a plan that became outdated because another ccam process changed the groups is refused with `the groups changed while this plan waited; nothing was moved, make the change again`. While another ccam process changes the groups, a new change, rename or remove says `another ccam is changing the groups right now`; after a change that stopped halfway, they wait until `F` on the Health tab (or `ccam doctor --fix`) has finished it.

## Adding an account

`a` opens the wizard that `ccam add` also uses on a terminal:

1. The account name.
2. How it signs in: a Claude subscription now (in the browser), an [API key](/features/api), or a Claude subscription later.
3. For an API key: where ccam reads the key at each launch (`env:NAME` or `command:COMMAND`), the endpoint, how the key is sent and the model.
4. The groups to join, with `default` checked (if no groups exist yet, what the `default` group will share).
5. A shortcut command, if you want one.
6. A summary to confirm.

`Esc` goes back one step, and on the first step closes the wizard.

## Removing an account

`x` asks before anything happens, with No selected, and says what the removal does: `It is logged out first (its login is revoked), then its folder goes to ccam's trash; the groups' shared files stay.` For an API key account there is no login to revoke, and when another account holds the same login it is not logged out. An imported account keeps its folder: `It was imported, so its folder /home/me/.claude stays where it is: it leaves its groups first and keeps a copy of what they share, then ccam forgets it.`

## Colors

The colors follow the roles of Claude Code's terminal UI, so ccam looks at home next to it; group names get a color from their name. ccam asks the terminal for its background and picks a light or dark theme. Set one yourself at the top of `config.toml`, above the first `[[group]]`, `[[profile]]` or `[[folder]]`:

```toml
theme = 'dark'   # auto (default), dark, light, dark-daltonized, light-daltonized, dark-ansi, light-ansi
```

The `-daltonized` themes are for red-green color blindness and the `-ansi` themes use the terminal's own 16 colors. `NO_COLOR` turns colors off.

## Safety and edge cases

- The dashboard calls the same functions as the commands, so every rule holds: plans before data moves, refusals for running accounts, backups, and login tokens that never leave an account.
- The dashboard has no dry run: `ccam --dry-run` without a name prints how this folder's account would start, and `o` on an account offers a dry run of that one launch.
- The terminal is restored before Claude Code starts or the login opens.
- A screen too small for a dialog drops the tab's rows first; lines are cut with `…` rather than wrapped. On a short screen, blank lines and the tab description are dropped next, so the key-hint line stays visible. Below 40 columns or 8 rows the dashboard shows only `Too small: ccam needs 40x8 (now 36x7)`.
- `Ctrl+C` while a change, a removal, an update or a repair is being applied waits for it: the status line says `ccam quits when it is done.`
- After `U` has updated ccam, the offer does not come back when the dashboard returns from adding an account or a login.
